# Project 30: Arduino Clone Microcontroller Boards

Arduino is an [open-source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware) and software company.
Therefore, Arduino designs are  used by other manufactures to build products that are almost identical to the Arduino products except for the Arduino registered [trademark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark) which is only on Arduino products.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" height="431" src="/Images/ElegooUNOR3_600.png"> 
</p>  
  
Elegoo UNO R3 is a clone of the Arduino UNO R3 except it uses Elegoo logo instead of the Arduino trademark.

Elegoo UNO R3 USB interface identifies itself an Arduino UNO R3.

## Arduino Account    
To use the Arduino Web Editor which is used for IoT Cloud software development an Arduino account (free) is required. 

## Arduino Cloud Plan    
To use the Arduino Cloud and IoT Cloud a [Plan](https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans/?source=webide&redirect=https://create.arduino.cc/editor/wa9ony/9cb4e926-92fe-4a7b-9556-ad9ae326b902) is needed.  A Free Plan is available.  The first Plan that provides dashboard sharing is the Maker Plan at $5.99/month. The dashboard sharing feature is the reason I chose the Maker Plan.
    
The aboue image shows the Arduino Maker features. 
    
The [Arduino OPLA IoT kit](#P31) includes one year free Cloud Plan.

# Project 51: Learn C++ with Arduino Web Editor & Board 

<p align="center">
<img width="159" height="57" src="/Images/ArduinoWebEditorIcon.png">  
</p>

All three Arduino IDEs are based on C++.  Learning C++ is done by using the Arduino Web Editor, a Arduino board/clone and C++ training materials (videos, articles, books, etc.
+ [C++ Programming in easy steps, 6th edition 6th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-easy-steps-6th/dp/1840789719/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3CF6P6B0HVN3A&keywords=c%2B%2B+in+easy+steps&qid=1673365872&sprefix=C%2B%2B+in%2Caps%2C157&sr=8-1)
+ The Great Courses [Introduction to C++: Programming Concepts and Applications](https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/introduction-to-c-plus-plus-programming-concepts-and-applications)  

Using the Web Editior with Arduino Cloud allows the training sketches to be saved and accessed by different computers.  The Web Editor has a Monitor functions that is simple to use in learning C++.  By running the C++ program on the Arduino board no C++ compilier is needed on the computer with the Web Editor.  

The high level program structor is 
+ Initialization is left empty
+ Setup contains two lines of serial code for the Monitor and the C++ lessions code.
+ Loop is left empty
    
Summary
+ Create C++ program that uses the Web Editor Monitor.
+ Compile the C++ program on the Arduino Web Editor server and download into the Arduino board to run.
+ Web Editor Monitor displays the C++ output.    
      
## Learn C++ Lesson 1: Output Hello World
Purpose: Output Hello World to the Web Editor Monitor.
Files: [LearnC_1_HelloWorld.zip](/Arduino/LearC/LearnC_1_HelloWorld.zip)    

To setup the serial connection to the Arduino Web Editor Monitor.
  Serial.begin(9600);           // set the baud rate for the Monitor
  while (!Serial);              // wait for Web Editor Monitor to be ready
  delay(9000);                  // wait 9 seconds to fix bug
    
The C++ statement
    cout<<"Hello World<<;
is replaced by
    Serial.print("Hello World");  // send Hello World to the Monitor

Arduio IoT Cloud allows selected Arduino microcontroller boards 
+ to save data to the Arduino Cloud.
+ to share data to a mobile phone.
+ to be controlled by a mobile phone.
+ to communicate to another microcontroller board.

+ Arduino IoT Cloud 2021 - Getting Started with Arduino & ESP32 [YouTube](https://youtu.be/UFCmTZUoZ1M)      
   + Much better than the Arduino Cloud Explained
   + Started over: Deleted all Things, Device, Variables, Dashboard Panel, etc.     
    Only once did I get a LED on the OPLA to work in the IoT Cloud.
     + The iOS app worked.
     + Delay of 2 to 3 seconds after change the LED switch before anything happen.
   + Never solved the problem of Sketch generated by the Arduino IoT Cloud Thing "Untitled".
   + Monitor was very helpful showing the LED 
   + No connect to mqtts-sa.iot.arduino.cc:8883 
   + Added a green blinking LED on OPLA #4 RGB LED to show that the OPLA was working. 

    
URLs
+  [cloud.arduino.cc](cloud.arduino.cc)

What is needed
+ Arduino account (free)
+ Arduino Cloud [plan](https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans/) 
Free plan shown below will work

## Very Poor IoT Cloud Results    
[Arduino Cloud Explained](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/arduino-cloud-explained/1)
+ Followed the webinar, no working OPLA.
  + Device status offline, could never get online status
  + Sketch generated by the Arduino IoT Cloud Thing "Untitled", could never get this to change to the Thing name.
  + Gave up after one day of on no progress.

## Personal Weather Station template  
The Personal Weather Station template is simple to use and it worked the first time.
+ I changed the temperature maximum form 100 to 40 C.
+ I added C to the temperature label. 

Below is the Personal Weather Station panel on Chrome/Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS.      
<p align="center">
<img width="600" height="280" src="/Images/weatherstationReadings600.png">

+ Had to close/restart the IoT Cloud app to get it working with the Personal Weather Station.

Below is the Personal Weather Station panel on iPhone.

## Summary
+ IoT Cloud rarely works except for using the Personal Weather Station template. I spent several days and it only worked once and slowly when it did.
+ IoT Cloud needs a good wizard.

+ [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/u6esn-DFMuk?feature=share) short shows the RGB LED test running.   
+ [Software/Sketch/ReadMe](https://github.com/WA9ONY/RP2040_and_Arduino/blob/main/Arduino/OPLA/sketch_OPLAsw1.zip)    
    
Goals
+ Have fun with the RGB LEDs.
+ Use the Arduino Web Editor.
+ Learn how to program the OPLA RGB LEDs.
+ Learn how to use C++ functions.
+ Create a YouTub short of the RGB LED test with the iPhone & YouTube app.
+ Create the ReadMe.adoc file that is part of the ZIP file.    

## OPLA_RGB_LED_Test Script    

Some of the LED test functions were commented out in the Loop to make the run time under one minute for the YouTube short.    

The LED functions were place in the initialization section of the Arduino program.    

Some of the LED function vary the LED intensity.

# Project 58: Arduino IoT Cloud Over-the-Air
<p align="center">
<img width="479" height="48" src="/Images/OverTheAir.png">  
</p>

The above image shows the Arduino Web Editor connected to the WeatherStation - Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 by Over-the-Air (IoT Cloud to WiFi to MKR WiFi 1010) and not by the computer USB interface to the MKR WiFi 1010.  The MKR WiFi 1010 can be remotely updated.   

<p align="center">
<img width="566" height="53" src="/Images/ArdWebEditorUSB.png">  
</p>

The above image shows the Arduino IDE connected to the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 by Linux computer USB port /dev/ttyACM0.   
    
Arduino IoT Cloud supports the ability to update the microcontroller software by IoT Cloud WiFi.  The IoT device does not need to be attached to the computer that is editing the device software.  The device software is located on the Arduino Cloud which is different than the IoT Cloud.  The Web Editor is used to edit the sketches on the Arduion Cloud.
    
For example, I used a Raspberry Pi computer on the Amateur Radio ARDEN Mesh network to edit the software of the Arduino OPLA Personal Weather Station IoT Cloud that was connected to a Linux computer.  The Linux computer could have been replaced by a simple USB power source.  
    
Over-the-Air Updates Requirements
  + A working Arduino IoT device.
  + The IoT device has a WiFi connection to the Arduino IoT Cloud server.
  + Edit the device sketch with Arduino Web Editor with connection to the Arduino IoT Cloud server.
  + Arduino account (free) and Arduino Cloud [Plan](https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans) (Entry plan at $1.99/month or highter level Cloud plans).

# Project 104: Google Generative AI: Create an Arduino program to blink the Uno R3 LED.

<PRE>
const int LED_PIN = 13;

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  delay(1000);
} 

</PRE>   
This program will blink the LED connected to the pin 13 of the Arduino Uno R3 board. The LED will be turned on for 1 second and then turned off for 1 second. This will continue indefinitely until the Arduino Uno R3 board is turned off.
Here is a brief explanation of the code:
+ The `const int LEDPIN = 13;` line defines a constant named `LEDPIN` that is set to the value 13. This is the pin number of the Arduino Uno R3 board + that is connected to the LED.
+ The `void setup()` function is called once when the Arduino Uno R3 board is turned on. This function is used to initialize the LED pin as an output pin.
+ The `void loop()` function is called repeatedly in a loop. This function is used to turn the LED on and off.
+ The `digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);` line turns the LED on. The `HIGH` argument tells the Arduino Uno R3 board to turn the output pin on.
+ The `delay(1000);` line waits for 1 second. This delay is used to create a pause between the time the LED is turned on and the time it is turned off.
+ The `digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);` line turns the LED off. The `LOW` argument tells the Arduino Uno R3 board to turn the output pin off.
+ The `void loop()` function will continue to run indefinitely until the Arduino Uno R3 board is turned off.
